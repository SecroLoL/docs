# Contextual Recall

The contextual recall scorer is a default LLM judge scorer that measures whether the `retrieval_context` aligns with the `expected_output`. 
In practice, this scorer helps determine whether your RAG pipeline's retriever is effectively retrieving relevant contexts.

`Tip`:

There are many factors to consider when evaluating the quality of your RAG pipeline. `judgeval` offers a suite of default scorers to construct a comprehensive 
evaluation of each RAG component. Check out our guide on RAG system evaluation for a deeper dive! TODO add link here.

## Required Fields

To run the contextual recall scorer, you must include the following fields in your `Example`:
- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `expected_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Scorer Breakdown

`ContextualRecall` scores are calculated by first determining all statements made in `expected_output`, then classifying which statements are backed up by the `retrieval_context`. 
Note that this scorer uses the `expected_output` rather than `actual_output` because we're interested in whether the retriever is performing well.

The score is calculated as:

$$
\text{Contextual Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Statements in Retrieval Context}}{\text{Number of Relevant Statements in Expected Output}}
$$

TODO: add source paper for this approach

## Sample Implementation

```
from judgeval.judgment_client import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import JudgmentScorer
from judgeval.constants import APIScorer

client = JudgmentClient()
example = Example(
    input="What's your return policy for a pair of socks?",
    # Replace this with your LLM system's output
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day return policy for all items, including socks!",
    # Replace this with the ideal output from your RAG generator model
    expected_output="All customers are eligible for a 30-day return policy, no questions asked.",
    # Replace this with the contexts retrieved by your RAG retriever
    retrieval_context=["Return policy, all items: 30-day limit for full refund, no questions asked."]
)
# supply your own threshold
scorer = JudgmentScorer(threshold=0.8, score_type=APIScorer.CONTEXTUAL_RECALL)

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4o",
)
print(results)
```

`Note:` 

The `ContextualRecall` scorer uses an LLM judge, so you'll receive a reason for the score in the `reason` field of the results. 
This allows you to double-check the accuracy of the evaluation and understand how the score was calculated.
